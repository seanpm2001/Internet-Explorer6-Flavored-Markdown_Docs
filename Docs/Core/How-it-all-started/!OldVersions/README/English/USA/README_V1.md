# IE6 Flavored Markdown documentation

## Core docs

### How it all started

It all started when GitHub made a change to Markdown on 2023, July 21st that carelessly broke millions of files (most of which cannot be fixed, due to archival status) where the following snippets were broken:

> **Note** This is a note

> **Warning** This is a warning

It has been so long that I forgot if the asterisks were required or not (just checked, they are) It was replaced with:

> [!NOTE]  
> Sample text

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Sample text

> [!WARNING]  
> Sample

Using blockquote. This change increased the verbosity of the Markdown process (more characters, more lines) and also broke every Markdown file that used the previous method, everything was working fine before this change.

GitHub is carelessly making Markdown more verbose and bloated through their fork of Markdown, known as GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) which is comparable to the feature problems with Internet Explorer 6 (the tipping point where Internet Explorer peaked, and then fell out of use, to be wiped out by Mozilla Firefox, and then Google Chrome) but so far, not also including its speed.

I continue to use the old style until Microsoft comes to their senses and at least makes the old way of doing things functional again alongside the new way.

This project was started on 2023, Thursday, November 9th, nearly 4 full months later. I didn't initially write notes for the project, so they were all written today. Until I remembered what was to be done, I felt like not doing this project today.
